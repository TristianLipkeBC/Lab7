# Lab7

For this lab I made a Makefile titled 'Makefile' and then added a csv file called vgsales.csv which had a list of the highest selling video games. Then I had it so that it would print out all of the Mario games within the dataset.

## Common Commands

Using make while in the Lab7 directory should print out the list of Mario games with all the information about the games included.
